# Matcha Minimal Example

This is a small project showing a minimal architecture to send and receive moves between a client and a server using the Matcha plugin.

You will need to install Matcha from the AssetLib as well as WebRTC plugin for the version of Godot you're using.

You can set Godot to open two instances of the game so that you can test connectivity.
